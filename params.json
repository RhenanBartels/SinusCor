{"name":"Sinuscor","tagline":"Advanced tool for heart rate variability analysis","body":"# SinusCor\r\n![Tachogram](/SampleFigures/sinuscor.png)\r\nSinusCor is an advanved tool for\r\n[Heart Rate Variability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8598068) distributed\r\nunder a freeware license, which means you can download and share without any\r\npayment. Along with classical indexes, SinusCor also allows you to analyze\r\nnon stationary HRV signals, like those recorded during an exercise bout.\r\n\r\nThe following figure illustrates a non stationary RRi example:\r\n\r\n![Tachogram](/SampleFigures/rri.png)\r\n##Instalation\r\nTo use SinusCor you need to download the .zip folder above and save it in\r\na directory of your choice. The code was developed using\r\n[Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/), therefore you need Matlab installed in your\r\nmachine together with the\r\n[Signal Processing Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/signal/?s_tid=srchtitle).\r\n\r\n###Tutorial Videos\r\nFor more information in how to use SinusCor, please watch the following tutorial\r\n[video](www.google.com).\r\n\r\n####Requirements\r\n* Matlab version >= 7.9.0.529 (R2009b)\r\n* Signal Processing Toolbox\r\n\r\n####Platform\r\n* Window, MacOS, Linux\r\n\r\n####Bugs\r\nIf you find any bug, please send an email to <mailto:rhenan.bartels@gmail.com>\r\nand the Bug will be fixed as soon as possible.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
